## About this Project

> Christina's Challenge - create a landing page

I created a challenge for myself after watching a YouTube video: [How I Would Become a Web Developer in 6 Months | Legit Step By Step Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB4bSDznwgM)

It was pretty inspiring to watch someone who is now making well over a $100k salary, give advice on what kinds of things I should probably work on to make a good portfolio to have something to show to employers when I apply to jobs, and what employers would probably be looking for. Sure, everyone can follow tutorials, but what kinds of things have you created on your own? That question was the most important one. What can I do all on my own, using my existing knowledge of programming, and a good amount of Googling, and learning how to search the internet effectively?

What can't I do? This project is to show off my skills of experimenting with different elements of a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because...why not?  This is a way to learn as much as I can on my own, and to get more comfortable with navigating the UNIX shell, making directories, and exploring hidden files, creating branches, merging branches, deleting branches.

Also, I am using Git & GitHub for this. Working on my own computer, in a folder. Then I use $ git init, add the changes, make sure I'm on the right branch, make a commit, write a relevant commit message, and then push the project onto GitHub, where we are now.

READMEs are generated using language known as markdown, which translates your READMEs into HTML. GitHub, Stack Overflow, Slack, Reddit, etc. all use versions of markdown for quick formatting of your content.
